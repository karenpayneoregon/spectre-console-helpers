# About

[![](assets/home-ec.png)](index.md) main page

This repository started out showing how to use the following NuGet package [SpectreConsoleLibrary](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpectreConsoleLibrary/) but has morphed. Hence the code for this package is still here but not the focus anymore.

Source code for pre-build inputs for [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/).

See [SpectreConsole.md](SpectreConsole.md)

# What is the focus now?

Working with EF Core 6, see [index.md](index.md)
