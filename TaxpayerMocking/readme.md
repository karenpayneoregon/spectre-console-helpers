This project demonstrates dynamically creating a SQL-Server LocalDb database using EF Core and Bogus.

Not something an enterprise developer would do, instead the better method is to create a database in SSMS than reverse engineer the database using a Visual Studio extension like EF Power Tools.

> **Note**
> There are no free extensions or tools to reverse engineer Oracle. A developer needs to use the dotnet CLI tools to scaffold an Oracle database or create your own tool such as one Karen created shown below.
