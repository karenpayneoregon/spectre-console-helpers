# Quick Actions

Quick Actions let you easily refactor, generate, or otherwise modify code with a single action.

The icon that appears when a Quick Action is available gives an indication of the type of fix or refactoring that's available. The `screwdriver screwdriver` icon icon indicates just that there are actions available to change the code, but you shouldn't necessarily use them. The `yellow light bulb` light bulb icon icon indicates there are actions available that you should do to improve your code. The `error light bulb` icon icon indicates there's an action available that fixes an error in your code.

## Common Quick Actions

See full list at Microsoft docs [![](assets/Link_16x.png)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/common-quick-actions?view=vs-2022&tabs=csharp) as there are way too many to list here.

## Generate From Usage feature

Visual Studio generates the new types and members with minimal interruption to your workflow. You can create stubs for types, methods, properties, fields, or constructors without leaving your current location in code. When you open a dialog box to specify options for type generation, the focus returns immediately to the current open file when the dialog box closes.
